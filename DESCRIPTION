Description: This package provides the users to define Areas of Interests
    (AOIs) for an image and the data is summarized based on the defined AOIs.
    Common eye tracking visualization tools, include dot plot, bar chart, box
    plot, heat map, scatter plot, scanpath visualization, and AOI timelines,
    are provided in this package. Linked microposter plots and linked scanpath
    microposter plots are implemented in this package. For mobile eye tracker
    data, an option is provided to automatically extract the coordinates of
    where the focus points are on a poster, however, Matlab is required to be
    installed for this option.
