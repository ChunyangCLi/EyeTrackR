# EyeTrackR
This repository is the EyeTrackR R package.

This package provides the users to define Areas of Interests
(AOIs) for an image and the data is summarized based on the defined AOIs.
Common eye tracking visualization tools, include dot plot, bar chart, box
plot, heat map, scatter plot, scanpath visualization, and AOI timelines,
are provided in this package. Linked microposter plots and linked scanpath
microposter plots are implemented in this package. For mobile eye tracker
data, an option is provided to automatically extract the coordinates of
where the focus points are on a poster, however, Matlab is required to be
installed for this option.
